# Security Policy

## Supported versions

RDXmin is pre-1.0. Only the latest published release on npm receives security fixes.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| latest `0.x` | ✅ |
| older `0.x` | ❌ |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security problems.**

Email **jay.pokale.35@gmail.com** with:

- what the vulnerability is and where (file / function),
- steps to reproduce,
- impact (what an attacker gains).

You'll get an acknowledgement within 72 hours. Fixes for confirmed issues ship in the
next patch release, with credit unless you ask otherwise.

## Why this matters here

RDXmin runs hooks in your agent session and writes a flag file. The config layer
(`hooks/rdx-config.js`) is symlink-safe by design (`O_NOFOLLOW`, `0600`). If you find a
way to escape that — path traversal, symlink follow, privilege escalation through the
installer — that's exactly the kind of report this policy is for.
